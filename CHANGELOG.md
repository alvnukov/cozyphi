# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

This project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- TUI hot-reloads the git branch in the path label: switching branches outside the app (another terminal, an editor) refreshes the label automatically.

### Changed

- TUI activity: tool rows keep a 1-cell braille spinner; the footer uses an
  Knight-Rider scan bar so the two don't share the same glyph.
- **Breaking:** hooks are declared in `plugin.json` (one file, many hooks) instead of
  per-directory `hook.json`. Load `~/.phi/hooks/plugin.json` and
  `~/.phi/hooks/<plugin>/plugin.json` (same under the project `.phi/hooks/`).

### Deprecated

### Removed

- Per-hook `hook.json` directories. Use `plugin.json` instead.

### Fixed

## [0.12.0] - 2026-08-17

### Added

- Changelog gate: PRs must update `CHANGELOG.md` (with skip labels / `[chore]`), released sections are protected, and GitHub Release notes are taken from this file.

### Changed

- Hashline `edit` now requires a whole-file `@file path#TAG` (`hash` field) from `read`/`grep`; after a successful edit, re-read before another `edit` on that path. Per-line hashes are 3 letters (a-z) and no longer use digits.

### Removed

- Remove the redundant `agent_task` tool; compose `agent_spawn` + `agent_wait` instead.

## [0.11.0] - 2026-08-16

Baseline release when this changelog became the source of truth for user-visible changes.
Earlier releases are available from GitHub tags only.
