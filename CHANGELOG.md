# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

This project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `phi run --yolo`: skip all permission checks for one headless run (benchmarks / CI).
- Hooks: session lifecycle events now include `usage` — token counts of the latest completed assistant turn.
- Hooks: `post_turn` event fires after each completed assistant stream with per-round `usage` (for audit metrics such as cache hit ratio).

### Changed

- TUI renders on demand instead of a constant 60 fps ticker: idle sessions
  write zero bytes to the terminal and use no CPU. Splash sphere, footer
  spinner, and toast expiry drive their own frames via `DrawContext.Wake`.
- Vendored `xui` (via `go.mod` `replace`): the renderer keeps a cursor diff
  cache, skips empty frames, and hides/shows the cursor only on frames that
  paint — fixing the idle cursor jitter.

## [0.16.0] - 2026-08-22

### Added

- Hooks: `command` UI intents — `status` (footer), `list` (palette page).
- Hooks: session lifecycle events `session_start`, `session_shutdown`, `session_before_switch`.

## [0.15.0] - 2026-08-20

### Added

### Changed

### Deprecated

### Removed

- `agent_list` `status` filter parameter (always returns the full list; each row still includes `status`).

### Fixed

### Security

## [0.14.0] - 2026-08-20

### Added

- Hook event `command`: `plugin.json` entries register TUI slash commands (`/name` runs `run`). stdout may `submit` a user message or `toast`.

### Changed

- `write` creates or overwrites files (no longer create-only). Use `edit` for surgical changes.
- File tools resolve relative paths against the session cwd and print cwd-relative results (`find`/`ls`/`grep`/`read`/`write`/`edit`). Absolute paths are used internally (including rg/fd) and returned only when the file is outside cwd.
- `find` (formerly `glob`) uses `fd` from `~/.phi/bin` (same as `rg`): respects `.gitignore`, early-stops at limit, optional `limit` arg.
- Renamed directory listing tool `list` → `ls`.

### Deprecated

### Removed

- Built-in `fetch` tool (and `permissions.fetch` config). Use MCP if you still need URL fetching.
- `agent_log` tool (parent agents only get `agent_wait` summaries; job logs remain on disk under `~/.phi/jobs/`).

### Fixed

- `phi update` on Windows: stage the download next to the installed binary (same volume) and fall back to copy when rename still cannot cross drives.
- Assistant fenced code blocks drop the box/`-----` chrome; a muted language caption sits above the highlighted code so mouse selection stays copy-clean.

### Security

## [0.13.0] - 2026-08-18

### Added
- TUI hot-reloads the git branch in the path label: switching branches outside the app (another terminal, an editor) refreshes the label automatically.

### Changed
- TUI activity: tool rows keep a 1-cell braille spinner; the footer uses an
  Knight-Rider scan bar so the two don't share the same glyph.
- Tool routing: bash is no longer described as an inspection tool; grep/glob no
  longer nudge `agent_spawn`; `edit.hash` is the 4 hex chars after `#` in
  `@file path#TAG` (leading `#` / full header copy-paste is accepted).
- **Breaking:** hooks are declared in `plugin.json` (one file, many hooks) instead of
  per-directory `hook.json`. Load `~/.phi/hooks/plugin.json` and
  `~/.phi/hooks/<plugin>/plugin.json` (same under the project `.phi/hooks/`).

### Deprecated

### Removed
- Per-hook `hook.json` directories. Use `plugin.json` instead.

### Fixed

### Security

## [0.12.0] - 2026-08-17

### Added

- Changelog gate: PRs must update `CHANGELOG.md` (with skip labels / `[chore]`), released sections are protected, and GitHub Release notes are taken from this file.

### Changed

- Hashline `edit` now requires a whole-file `@file path#TAG` (`hash` field) from `read`/`grep`; after a successful edit, re-read before another `edit` on that path. Per-line hashes are 3 letters (a-z) and no longer use digits.

### Removed

- Remove the redundant `agent_task` tool; compose `agent_spawn` + `agent_wait` instead.

## [0.11.0] - 2026-08-16

Baseline release when this changelog became the source of truth for user-visible changes.
